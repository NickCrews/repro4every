# Updating team members

- If someone wants to be added to the website under Team Members, they should complete the Google Form available at [https://forms.gle/fAWPVWp3h61sZHpy5](https://forms.gle/fAWPVWp3h61sZHpy5).
- This will create an entry in the Google Spreadsheet in our Shared Google Drive under the folder `Reproducibiity4Everyone/Contributing to R4E`
- To add contents from this spreadsheet to the website do the following:

  - In this repo create a new file in the `_team_members` directory called `member_[number].md` where [number] should be replaced by the next number 
  - The file should be structured as follows: 
```
---
name: Aparna Shah
designation: Johns Hopkins University
twitter: Neuro_Musings
linkedin: test
---
```
   - The website will automatically add the newly created member in alphabetical order with the next build
   - Nothing else to do
