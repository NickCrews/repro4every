In this post the author, along with collaborators from the Reproducibility for Everyone initiative gives some context about how the initiative came to life and where we are headed.

##### Some of the lessons they learned along the way:

- Instead of continuously talking about a problem and potential solutions, take actionable steps - In the case of this collaboration, the “Reproducibility for Everyone” team was assembled when it was realized that interactive workshops that train and provide researchers with tools and best practices could be an actionable way to address the widespread issue of irreproducibility.

- Use your network well to seek out valuable and impactful opportunities - There are many brilliant minds out there, but how do you get them to connect? Through [networking][networking] of course! Thanks to individuals in the group who were well connected, this diverse and international team assembled the right people at the right time.

- Be inclusive and seek solutions by working with communities, not for them - Another strength of this collaboration is that it is driven by academics, with support of industry partners, not the other way around. Sometimes, due to misconceptions and stereotypes, solving a community’s issue without involving them can do more harm than good. Check out [this webinar][webinar] for more on this.
