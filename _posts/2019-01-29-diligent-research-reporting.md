_"Imagine spending months trouble-shooting a technique when another researcher has already done so and recorded in a lab book or a private computer in the lab. Lenny Teytelman was frustrated by this via first-hand experience in the lab as a postdoc. Upon exploring the web, he realized that the scientific community needs an effective way to share detailed protocols and improved techniques with the research community at large. During completing his postdoctoral work at Massachusetts Institute for Technology, he co-founded [protocols.io][protocols] in 2012 to create a free, central, up-to-date, crowd-sourced protocol repository [1,2]."_
