The past week was characterised by huge activity in the Twitterverse by the Reproducibility for Everyone group. [Angela Abitua][angela] from Addgene, along with eLife Ambassadors, [Nafisa Jadavji][nafisa] and [Mariella Paul][mariella], lead a Twitter campaign in lead up to the Reproducibility workshops that will be taking place at the [22nd Penn State Plant Biology Symposium][PBS] and [ASM Microbe 2019][ASM] in Pennsylvania and San Francisco respectively.

The week kicked off on Monday, 10 June. At that stage the [@repro4everyone][twitter] Twitter handle had around 30 followers. By Friday that number had grown to 154 followers! 

Here is a quick look at the topics that were covered:

- Monday: Intro to the R4E group
- Tuesday: Data management and electronic lab notebooks
- Wednesday: Wet lab protocols and reagent sharing
- Thursday: Bioinformatics tools and data sharing
- Friday: Image and data analysis

Several polls were run throughout the week. Here are some examples:
