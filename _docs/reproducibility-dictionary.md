# About the Dictionary

We realise that this site will get visitors from a wide variety of research disciplines, countries, cultures, job titles, and career stages. 
In the interest of making this resource as accessible as possible, we would like to invite you to contribute to our "Reproducibility Dictionary" if
you find terminology that you are unsure of, or if you think someone else may have trouble with it. Please <a href="https://forms.gle/Mq3eHGU9xD7UcRqWA">complete the form to contribute</a> your
word or phrase. We will include it in future releases of the website. Thanks!

## Computational Reproducibility

Obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.

## Container

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Electronic Lab Notebook

An electronic lab notebook (also known as electronic laboratory notebook, or ELN) is a computer program designed to replace paper laboratory notebooks. Lab notebooks in general are used by scientists, engineers, and technicians to document research, experiments, and procedures performed in a laboratory. A lab notebook is often maintained to be a legal document and may be used in a court of law as evidence. Similar to an inventor's notebook, the lab notebook is also often referred to in patent prosecution and intellectual property litigation.

## Environment (in terms of Software)

Software environment is the term commonly used to refer to support an application. A software environment for a particular application could include the operating system, the database system, specific development tools or compiler.

## Literate Programming

A traditional computer program consists of a text file containing program code. Scattered in amongst the program code are comments which describe the various parts of the code. In literate programming the emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes documentation containing code.

## Replicability

Obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.

## RRID

RRID is a Research Resource Identifier (a persistent and unique identifier for referencing research resources) as provided through the [Resource Identification Portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources). Here the term 'resource' 
refer to biomedical resources such as antibodies, plasmids, organisms, cell lines, and even software tools.
